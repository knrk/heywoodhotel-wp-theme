			<section id="cancellation">
				<h3>Cancellation and Change Policy</h3>
				<p>As a small, independent property, we ask for your understanding in respecting our cancellation, change and no-show policy. Please read carefully.</p>

				<p>If you must change, shorten or cancel your reservation, do so within the timeframe indicated below for a full refund minus the specified change/cancellation fee (per room). If a reservation is cancelled or shortened after the cancellation period expires, the guest is responsible for full payment of the original reservation unless the room(s) is re-booked. Changes or cancellations must be made via phone or by email, and <em>you must receive a confirmation email from Heywood Hotel</em>. There are no refunds for early departure.</p>

				<p><strong>Inclement Weather Policy:</strong> Austin is lucky to enjoy 300 sunny days per year (in fact, we locals usually celebrate when it rains)! Please understand that we cannot be responsible for inclement weather or other causes for delays and cancellations at your point of origin or the locations you may connect through when traveling to visit us. We strongly advise you to purchase travel insurance if you are traveling during periods of inclement weather or you have other reasons to suspect you may need to cancel your reservation. We thank you for your understanding! </p>

				<p><strong>Re-booking Policy:</strong> If you cancel your reservation after the cancellation period expires, we will attempt to re-book your room as a courtesy to you. If your room is re-booked at the guaranteed rate, you will be charged the applicable change/cancellation fee noted below, plus a processing fee equal to 10% of the original reservation amount. If your room does not re-book, you are responsible for full payment of the original reservation. </p>

			<div>
				<h3>General Policies</h3>
				<br>
				<section id="checkin">
					<h4>Check In and Checkout</h4>
					<span>Check in is between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. <i>If you are arriving later than 7:00, it’s no problem, but please let us know so that we can make arrangements.</i> Checkout is 11:00 a.m.. We have a small, awesome staff that needs time to prepare rooms for arriving guests. If you require more time, a late checkout can sometimes be arranged with prior notification for $25 per hour. Please submit your request the night before.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="children">
					<h4>Children</h4>
					<span>We love kids, but our property is oriented toward responsible adults and not suitable for children. Children over the age of 10 may be considered but must be accompanied by a parent and must stay in the parent's room. For full property rentals, please inquire. Please also see "Minimum Age" below.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="creditcards">
					<h4>Credit Card Authorization and Payment</h4>
					<span>A valid credit card is required to make a reservation. We accept all major credit cards. Your credit card will be authorized for the full reservation amount at the time the cancellation period expires (see cancellation timeframes above). If using a debit card, please note that your bank will hold your funds at this time; for this reason, bank cards are typically discouraged for all hotel reservations. Your credit card and a valid ID must be presented at check in, at which time you will be charged. For alternate forms of payment or third-party payment, please inquire.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="damage">
					<h4>Damage to Property</h4>
					<span>Guests are responsible for any damage or loss they cause to the property. <em>Guests may be charged for, or charged cleaning fees for, damaged, destroyed or excessively soiled towels, linens and other soft goods</em>. For full property reservations and in other situations under management's discretion, a damage and security deposit will be required. Also see "No Smoking, No Candles, No Incense, Etc." below. </span>
				</section>
				<section id="group_reservations">
					<h4>Group Reservations</h4>
					<span>Due to our small, home-like environment, and to ensure the comfort and enjoyment of all guests, we have special policies regarding group reservations. Group reservations are limited to a maximum of 6 guests (typically 3 rooms), except in the case of full-property rentals. For full-property rentals, a maximum of 15 guests are allowed. <em>Before booking online, please email us regarding your group's stay so that we can mutually determine if our hotel is a good fit for you. All group rentals of 3 or more rooms will be reviewed by management prior to official confirmation.</em> Therefore, reservation requests submitted online for 3 or more rooms, or individual online reservation requests that constitute a group reservation of 3 or more rooms, are considered unconfirmed requests until personally confirmed by a manager via email.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="min-age">
					<h4>Minimum Age</h4>
					<span>You must be 21 to rent our property or occupy a guestroom without a parent.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="min-stay">
					<h4>Minimum Night Stay</h4>
					<span>Our standard minimum night stay on weekends is 2 nights, requiring booking of 2 consecutive nights in the same room (for example, Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday). Some holidays and special events may subject to longer minimums. Rooms are occasionally released for 1-night stays, based on availability, as reflected on our Reservations page. You are encouraged to submit a waitlist request if you only need a single night and the online booking engine requires a longer stay.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="smoking">
					<h4>No Smoking, No Candles, No Incense, Etc.</h4>
					<span>The Heywood is strictly a nonsmoking facility. Smoking is allowed only in the designated smoking area at the rear of the property. Smoking is not allowed in the building, in guest rooms, in public outdoor areas or in private outdoor patios and courtyards. Evidence of smoking including the smell of smoke in the room or in the public and private outdoor areas will result in a minimum $250 charge plus the cost of any damaged property. (Yes friends, we mean any kind of smoke.) No burning of any sort of object including candles or incense is allowed, and no other strongly-scented items are allowed in rooms. All of the above are subject to cleaning and damage fees.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="non-hosted">
					<h4>Non-hosted Facility</h4>
					<span>Heywood Hotel management and staff are on site between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. to tend to your needs. A number will be provided for you to call should you need assistance at any hour, day or night.
				</section>
				<section id="occupancy">
					<h4>Occupancy</h4>
					<span>All guest rooms accommodate single or double occupancy. Room 7 sleeps 3 with an additional single-size sleeper sofa for an extra charge (ranging from $35/night to $50/night depending on date) for the additional guest.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="parking">
					<h4>Parking</h4>
					<span>Off-street parking is available, but limited. One free off-street parking space (max) is typically available for each guest room. Additional free parking is available on nearby streets. Please respect the neighboring businesses and do not park in their lots; you may be towed. We are not responsible for damage to vehicles, or damage or loss of property left in parked vehicles, regardless of location.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="parties">
					<h4>Parties, Events and Gatherings</h4>
					<span>We are a small hotel. Please do not come here to party. Guests who disturb other guests will be asked to leave and will not be provided a refund. Thinking of inviting some friends over? Please check with us first! Due to the intimate nature of our property, private events that include guests not staying at the property require approval. A separate events agreement and additional fees may apply. No parties, group gatherings, company meetings, etc. may be held without prior approval, and may forfeit your reservation without refund.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="pets">
					<h4>Pets</h4>
					<span>Though you might see Zelda, the neighborhood hen, roaming the property, we are unfortunately unable to accommodate pets. No exceptions. We are sorry.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="phones">
					<h4>Phones</h4>
					<span>We do not provide telephones in the guest rooms because so many guests travel with their own phones. We provide a guest phone in the lobby with free long distance. We ask that you be courteous to other guests and kindly monitor your time and volume while using the phone.</span>
				</section>
				<section id="quiet-hours">
					<h4>Quiet Hours</h4>
					<span>Please show respect for other guests and keep noise to a minimum between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. We are a small hotel. Please do not come here to party. Guests who disturb other guests will be asked to leave and will not be provided a refund. </span>
				</section>
				<section id="rules">
					<h4>Rules and Regulations</h4>
					<span>We try to not have too many of them, and we thank you for reading our policies. We hope you will love every minute of your stay at the Heywood, and know how much we appreciate having you as our guest. We welcome and sincerely appreciate the opportunity to address any concerns or correct problems -- we want your stay to be great. If there's anything we can do to improve our odds of achieving greatness, we hope you will let us know.</span>
